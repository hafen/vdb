  "description": "Trelliscope provides a way to create, organize, and view multi-panel displays, a collection of which is called a visualization database (VDB).  This package provides a mechanism for extending the ideas of Trellis Display to easily generate and organize plots, providing a dynamic viewer for tiling panels of a display across the screen and paging through them. There is also a mechanism to generate built-in or user-defined 'cognostic' metrics for each panel of a display , and the viewer has the ability to sort or filter the pages based on these cognostics.  This is useful for large multi-panel displays where it is not possible to view each panel, allowing only panels with interesting features to be presented.  This package also provides a way to meaningfully organize and present these displays in a 'lab notebook'.",
